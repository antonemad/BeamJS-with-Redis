# How to Contribute to BeamJS: Adding Redis Support

BeamJS is a modular and enterprise-grade backend framework built on
Node.js. It enables developers to build scalable, secure, and adaptive
systems with strong behavioral logic.\
This article explains how to contribute to BeamJS by adding support for
Redis as a new database integration layer.

## 1. Understanding the Goal

The purpose of this contribution is to extend BeamJS with Redis
support.\
Redis is an in-memory data structure store used for caching, sessions,
and fast data access.\
By adding a Redis adapter, BeamJS can handle caching and temporary data
more efficiently alongside other supported databases like MongoDB and
SQL.

## 2. Setting Up the Project Locally

1\. Fork the BeamJS repository from GitHub.\
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:\
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beamjs.git\
3. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:\
npm install\
4. Make sure the project runs successfully before making any changes.

## 3. Creating the Redis Adapter

Inside the source folder, create a new module called \'redis-adapter\'.\
This module will handle all Redis-related logic, such as connecting to
the Redis server, storing, and retrieving data.\
\
Example basic structure:\
/src/adapters/redis/\
├── index.js\
├── redisClient.js

You can use the official Redis Node.js client (ioredis or redis package)
to handle the connection.\
The adapter should follow the same design patterns as the existing
adapters for databases like MongoDB.

## 4. Integrating with BeamJS Core

Once the Redis adapter is created, you need to integrate it into the
main framework.\
This usually means registering the adapter in the main configuration or
adapter loader file.\
This allows users to select Redis as a supported database option when
initializing BeamJS.

## 5. Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, make sure to test:\
- Connection to Redis server (local or cloud).\
- Basic operations like SET, GET, and DELETE.\
- Integration with existing modules if required.\
\
You can write small integration tests under the test/ directory to
verify that the adapter works correctly.

## 6. Submitting Your Contribution

1\. Commit your changes with a clear message:\
git commit -m \"Add Redis support to BeamJS\"\
2. Push your branch to your GitHub repository.\
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the main BeamJS repository.\
4. In your PR description, explain what you added and how it works.

## 7. Conclusion

Adding Redis support helps BeamJS become more flexible and powerful.\
It's a great way to contribute by extending the framework's database
capabilities.\
Always make sure to follow BeamJS coding guidelines and keep your
implementation modular and maintainable.
